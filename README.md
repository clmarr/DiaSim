# DiaSim

For a run with default configurations, in command line call: bash std_derive.sh

To specify run name, ruleset, and lexicon file: bash derive.sh <RUN_NAME> <RULESET> <LEXFILE>

You may also edit derive.sh and std_derive.sh to designate targets of your choosing.

# CURRENTLY UNDERGOING RENOVATION: This project is currently undergoing debugging and repackaging, and the command line above will likely have running errors if using the current beta or gamma branches. New version will be available: January 2023. 

To discuss any issues or concerns: email cl.st.marr@gmail.com, or marr.54@buckeyemail.osu.edu . I am trying my best to get this up and running by 2023; earlier versions do not have the current one's error with the processing of alpha-valued phonetic features, but they did have other bugs that were later discovered and fixed.
