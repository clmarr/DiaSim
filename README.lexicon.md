# README.lexicon:

This file details how to properly construct a lexicon file so that it can be read by DiaSim.

# COMMENTING

Any and all comments can only be placed in the final column and must be flagged with a "$". Typically they are used to cite the phonological forms and etymology of a word. For example, from our demonstration simulation for Classical Latin going to French: 

```
s ˌɑ ɡ m ˈɑː r i u m , s ɔ m j e $sommier. Pope s674.
```

# THE ROWS

Each row contains information on an etymon, whose diachronic development is to be simulated in DiaSim.
As demonstrated with the example of *sommier* above, it is conventional and preferable to use a comment clause (flagged by *$*) indicate the form this item is best known as, and preferably a source. 
Any other relevant info, such as remarks about attestations, relevance to discussions of interest, rival etymologies, etc., should also be placekd here, if pertinent.

The essential thing in each row to have is a sequence of phone symbols representing the item's state at its input stage. 
By default, standard IPA symbols defined in terms of distinctive features (in the file symbolDefs.csv) are to be used -- for more on this, and how to use your own symbol and feature sets, see the file "README.representations.md".
DiaSim performs forward reconstruction by simulating the realization of rules in the cascade file (see README.cascade.md) on each of these items. 
In the minimal-usage case, each row has only the input forms, the *forward reconstructed* results for each etymon will be presented and recorded and can be analyzed, but there is no mass comparison to observed forms and analysis. 
An example for what a row looks like for this minimal-usage scenario in the case of *sommier* is provided below: 

```
s ˌɑ ɡ m ˈɑː r i u m $sommier. Pope s674.
```

Notice compared to the example given for the same etymon *sommier* in the COMMENTING section, both rows have the phonological form of the Latin input (/sˌɑɡmˈɑːrium/) but unlike the one here, the minimum usage case shown here here lacks the phonological form of modern French *sommier* (/sɔmje/).
In all cases, the rules in the history of the development of Gallian Latin into French will be operated in order on a sequence that starts out as /sˌɑɡmˈɑːrium/.
The *forward reconstructed* results of this simulation for /sˌɑɡmˈɑːrium/ will be recorded and presented for analysis, but there will be no comparison to /sɔmje/ at the end, because it is not provided. 
In order to perform mass comparisons and analyses on observed (or 'gold') outcomes for each etymon, that material must be supplied in a different "cell" for each item in its row. 
Such cells are delimited by a comma (",").
The example of the row for *sommier* with two cells from the COMMENTING section is reproduced here for comparison: 

```
s ˌɑ ɡ m ˈɑː r i u m , s ɔ m j e $sommier. Pope s674.
```

Here we see that in addition to the input cell /sˌɑɡmˈɑːrium/, we have a row for the observed outcome in modern French: /sɔmje/.
Having this here enables us to compare the observed outcome -- the '*gold*' outcome -- with the outcome of forward reconstruction by DiaSim. 
Viewed vertically, the input forms in each row form the *first column*. 
This is also the only column in the minimal usage where only they are provided, but if there is to be mass comparison to observed (gold) outcomes at the end point or an intermediate point, there must be a column for that stage, which means it will have to have a cell in row. 

A row for *sommier* with gold forms for the modern French outcome and various intermediate stages is exemplified below: 

```
s ˌɑ ɡ m ˈɑː r i u m , s ˌɑ w m ˈɑ r ʝ o , s ˌu m ˈi e̯ r , s ˌũ m j ˈe r , s ˌũ m j ˈe r , s ɔ m j e $sommier. Pope s674.
```

Critically, each row must have the same number of cells: there is a set number of columns for the whole lexicon file.
For more detail on the columns and gold stages (for which mass comparison between reconstructed and observed outcomes is performed), see the following section "COLUMNS AND STAGES". 
 
Between the columns and the comment clause, one may enter a morphology clause flagged by '%'. For more info on this, see the section "MORPHOLOGICAL PARADIGM INFORMATION". 

# HEADER

The header must be flagged by having its first character as the symbol "~".

TODO -- check DiaSim behavior with regard to header (i.e. DiachronicSimulator.processLexFileHeader()). 
	TODO -- include behavior when header is not there
TODO -- explanation about header. 
TODO -- provide tester methods for header stuff
TODO -- explanation about input stage here.

# COLUMNS AND STAGES

Each column represents a different diachronic stage. 
If any form is given for a particular diachronic stage, a form must be given for every etymon at that stage.
As of June 2023, the expansion to include this is not yet public as it is still undergoing steps of construction and testing. 

The first column, the only required one, must contain the initial forms for each etymon at the beginning of the diachronic simulation. 
Specifically, in the case of our French demonstration set, this is the Classical Latin form. 
When and if other columns are specified, they should contain the phonological forms each etymon has at the stage corresponding to the column.

The forms entered in columns after the first column will be the gold standard phonological forms to which the forms obtained by the diachronic simulation at those stages will be compared. 
In order for simulation results at any point to be compared to a gold set, that set must be associated with a stage in the rules file and a column in the lexicon file, with its gold forms for each etymon in the lexicon file. 
Without exception, each column specified must uniquely correspond to a diachronic stage that is declared in the rules file (see rules.README.txt -- a stage should be on a line declared immediately after the last rule that applied to its forms). In the cascade file, a proper diachronic stage where the results of forward reconstruction upon each lexeme will be compared to gold forms must be flagged with a '~' character, as demonstrated below: 

```
~Middle French
```

Stages where the forms of etyma are just to be recorded, not compared, are instead flagged with a "=" character in the cascade file.
These are called "black stages", short for "black box stages". 
Inasmuch as the input stage does not contain gold forms to test *against*, it is effectively a black (box) stage as well. 

If a stage flagged in the cascade file a tilde (\~) as "Middle French" as above has the same name as a column header of the lexicon file, this will be treated as a "gold" stage, upon which systematic comparison between forward-reconstructed forms and the "gold" forms provided in the lexicon can be performed. It will otherwise be treated as a "black" stage (black box stage), which exists for purposes of easy extraction of forms and grounding for analyses, but does not have associated "gold" forms. 
Technically the tilde (\~) is the gold stagename flag, but it will only be treated as a true gold stage if an identically named stage is present as a column header in the lexicon file; otherwise the stage will be "blackened" -- converted into a black box stage -- before computerized forward reconstruction commences. 
The black stage header "=" may be used instead of "~" for disambiguatory purposes within the lexicon file.

DiaSim will automatically associate stages in the rules file, in the order they are declared, to columns other than the input column, from left to right. 
If there is exactly one more column in use after all declared stages are associated with columns to its left, then the system will assume that this is the specification of the final output.
If there are still columns to the right of this final column, then DiaSim will throw an error. 
Likewise, if there are too few columns so that not every stage declared in the rules file is associated with a column, then DiaSim will also throw an error. 

Here is a sample, showing the diachronic trajectory of Classical Latin *sagmarium* into French *sommier*, via the stages (from Pope's tables) of Classical Latin, Late Latin, Old French I (i.e. Early Old French), Old French II (i.e. Later Old French), Middle French and Modern French. 

```
Classical Latin , Late Latin , Old French I , Old French II , Middle French , Modern French
s ˌɑ ɡ m ˈɑː r i u m , s ˌɑ w m ˈɑ r ʝ o , s ˌu m ˈi e̯ r , s ˌũ m j ˈe r , s ˌũ m j ˈe r , s ɔ m j e $sommier. 
```

Note that a final stage starting with the string "Modern" or "modern", or otherwise (without regard to upper/lower case) "output", "res", "result", or "out", will be treated as equivalent to the final output of forward reconstruction, i.e. the results after executing the last rule in the cascade. 


In future versions of DiaSim, it will be possible to indicate that an etymon has either fallen out of use or entered the vocabulary late by specifying "--" for stages where it is not present in the lexicon. This will remove the item from the lexicon if it was present before, or mean it is not yet to be inserted otherwise. 
These will not contribute in any way to calculations of accuracy and error patterning at this gold stage. Use ">*" for etyma that are not attested at that stage but also still present in the lexicon, not to be removed, but not to be included in gold stage statistics either. 
A column that consists of only inserts or removals of etyma will be treated as a black box stage, not a gold stage. 
However, the functionality described above is not yet supported by the current release of DiaSim. 



# THE IMPORTANCE OF SPACING

Note that spaces necessarily delimit all functional symbols, phonetic/phonological or otherwise. Material not separated by a space is in most cases considered part of the same "symbol" functionally, and a space means items on either side will be considered functionally separate.
This applies to the cascade files as well. 


# MORPHOLOGICAL PARADIGM INFORMATION 

As of summer 2023, expansion of DiaSim to handle paradigmatic relations is underway. (TODO update when complete) 

For how to access automated paradigm based analyses making use of this info, this is handled in the *Paradigmatic analysis* section of README.suite.md. Note that inclusion of paradigmatic info in a line of the lexicon file is optional, and that the statistical analyses performed after and during a CFR run will only take into account items for which paradigmatic information is marked. 

Once the expansion of DiaSim to handle such paradigmatic info is completed and released, morphological info will be marked in lexicon files as follows: 

* '%' will be the flag for paradigmatic info within a line in the lexicon. Inclusion will be optional. The paradigmatic information will be placed between the diachronic phonology part of the line (i.e. input and then gold forms for stages and final output if applicable), and the comment clause flagged by '$'. Thus it will look as follows: 

```
d̪ ˈo r m i t̪ , d̪ ɔ ʁ %VERB<DORMIRE> {POS=VERB | PERSON=3 | NUMBER=SG} $dort.
ˈo k u l u m , œ j %NOUN<OCVLVM> {POS=NOUN | GENDER=MASC} $œil.  
ˈo k u l oː s , j ø %NOUN<OCVLVM> {GENDER=MASC | NUMBER=PL} $yeux.  
d̪ ˌo r m ˈiː r e , d̪ ɔ ʁ m i ʁ %VERB<DORMIRE> {POS=INF} $dort.
s ˌɑ p i ˈɑː t i s , s a ʃ j e %VERB<SAPERE> {MOOD=SUBJ | PERSON=2 | NUMBER=PL} $sachiez 
s ˌɑ p ˈuː t ɑː s , s y %VERB<SAPERE> {POS=ADJ | GENDER=FEM | NUMBER=PL} $sues. 
```

In each line above, again, paradigmatic info is found after the paradigm flag '%' and before the comment flag '$'. 
The paradigmatic info here consists of two components, in the following order: (1) the *lemma ID*, placed between '<' and '>' and flagged beforehand by the lemma's morpho-lexical category and (2) the *morphosyntactic feature-value clause*. 

## LEMMA ID 
The *lemma ID*, found between '<' and '>', contains a string that is a unique lemma for all forms that are considered to belong to the same paradigm -- those that are to be considered forms of the "same word" by DiaSim. 
It is flagged beforehand by the lemma's morpho-lexical category, which is potentially distinct from its morpho-*syntactic* category (see below, in next section). 
Abbreviations are enabled in the paradigm shape file (see two sections below), so either V or VERB can be used for verbs, and either N or NOMINAL can be used for nominals, a term that unites nouns and adjectives as (in the case of French) they share paradigm shape. 
Thus, as seen above, the second line (for *œil*) ad the third (*yeux*) share the same lemma ID (N<OCVLVM>), but this ID is not shared with the first line (*dort*), as that is not a form of the same word; instead the lemma ID of *dort* would probably be shared with lines for *dormir*, *dors*, et cetera. 

Note: it is advisable to avoid giving to give homophonous lemmata with the same morpholexical category the same lemma ID -- for example, Latin liber "free" and liber "book" are best given different lemma IDs like "LIBER1" and "LIBER2" (for the same reason, Latin based lemma IDs are preferred for Romance CFRs, because sound change can regularly create new homophony, but homophone splits do not regularly occur). This important because otherwise it will lead to unintended side effects in how paradigmatic stats are calculated: the erroneously conflated paradigms with homophonous lemmata will be considered the same, so any items with the same morphosyntactic feature specifications will be treated as being in *overabundant* cells within the same paradigm (erroneously increasing cell-wise rates of overabundance) and the two paradigms together with all their cells) will only contribute with a weight of one paradigm to statistical calculations performed for automated analyses by DiaSim. It is preferable to avoid giving the same lemma ID to distinct lemmata with different morpholexical categories but homophonous citation forms, but DiaSim will still handle it differently since it internally appends each lemma ID with its morpholexical category. 

A lemma's morpholexical category describes the lexical category of its root, and thus the shape of its paradigm. This is usually equivalent to its morphosyntactic category, which governs the word's syntactic distribution and agreement behavior, but there are cases where the two are not equivalent. For example, the French (morpholexical) verb paradigm is generally considered to include past participles (like *sues*, the last line) and infinitives (*dormir*, the fourth line), but past participles are morphosyntactically most like adjectives (inflecting as such as well), while the morphosyntactic behavior of infinitives is rather distinct and lacks the agreement marking (person, number) seen on morphosyntactic verbal items, as well as lacking other features present in other verbal forms like tense. As will be explained in the following section, the calculation of stats for feature value combinations will take such factors of morphosyntactically distinct parts of morpholexical paradigms into account.  



## MORPHOSYNTACTIC FEATURE-VALUE CLAUSE
TODO -- features defined wrt morphosyntactic classes? 

The *morphosyntactic feature-value clause*, bounded by '{' and '}', is placed between the lemma ID and the comment clause (if present, otherwise the end of the line), and consists of assignments of morphosyntactic values to morphosyntactic feature.
Each morphosyntactic feature is delimited from its value by '='; different feature-value assignments are delimited by '|'. The features here are morphosyntactic features, not semantic ones (i.e. a grammatically singular collective noun is thus singular, not plural; German *mädchen" is neuter, not feminine). 

The examples from the top of this section are reiterated here for easier reading: 

```
d̪ ˈo r m i t̪ , d̪ ɔ ʁ %VERB<DORMIRE> {POS=VERB | PERSON=3 | NUMBER=SG} $dort.
ˈo k u l u m , œ j %NOMINAL<OCVLVM> {POS=NOUN | GENDER=MASC} $œil.  
ˈo k u l oː s , j ø %N<OCVLVM> {GENDER=MASC | NUMBER=PL} $yeux.  
d̪ ˌo r m ˈiː r e , d̪ ɔ ʁ m i ʁ %V<DORMIRE> {POS=INF} $dort.
s ˌɑ p i ˈɑː t i s , s a ʃ j e %V<SAPERE> {MOOD=SUBJ | PERSON=2 | NUMBER=PL} $sachiez 
s ˌɑ p ˈuː t ɑː s , s y %V<SAPERE> {TENSE=PAST | POS=ADJ | GENDER=FEM | NUMBER=PL} $sues. 
```

As can be seen for the first line of the example above, *dort* is marked as having the value "VERB" for the feature "POS", "3" for "PERSON", and "SG" for "NUMBER". There is no marking for the fact that it is also present tense, and indicative mood: these are unnecessary as they are the default values for the features 'TENSE' and 'MOOD', which are assigned by default if they are not marked within the line of the lexicon file. Furthermore, note that in the second line of the example given at the top of this section, notice that *œil* is not marked as SG -- SG is actually the default for NUMBER, and doesn't need to be marked, though it *can* be if seen as desirable, as it is above for *dort*. However, the PL value for NUMBER must always be marked for this is a marked (non-default) value for the feature NUMBER. The usage of marked and unmarked here does not reflect a theoretical position, but rather a computational description of the behavior of DiaSim, not the behavior of language:  features that are computationally treated as default are thus functionally treated as *unmarked* by DiaSim not needing to be *marked*, and the rest thus need to be "*marked*" in the lexicon. 

Regarding "POS" (for *part of speech*), as noted in the section above, this is part of how DiaSim treats cells that differ morphosyntactically from their lemma's morpholexical class.
A form having a different morphosyntactic behavior from its morpholexical class is considered *marked*-- it must be specified as the value for the feature "POS" in the morphosyntactic feature-value clause. 
For example, this is necessary for French past participles (as in *sues*, last line of the examples) as they are morphosyntactically (most like) adjectives, and for infinitives (*dormir*, fourth line) which are morphosyntactically distinct. 
Meanwhile, having behavior falling within that which is typical of the lemma's morpholexical class is treated as having the same morphosyntactic and morpholexical classes, and is essentially *unmarked* -- it *can* be specified if desirable for notational reasons (as in the first and second lines of the example), but it can also be omitted (as in the third and fifth), as a morphosyntactic class identical to morpholexical class will be assigned by default -- more specifically, each morpholexical class has an *unmarked* (default) morphosyntactic case that will be automatically assigned unless otherwise specified: for the morpholexical class N(OMINAL) in the French paradigm shape file (see section below on how to read and write these files), the unarked morphosyntactic class is NOUN. 

Although notated like a morphosyntactic feature, morphosyntactic class stands out among other features in that it changes how other features are treated for purposes of paradigmatic analyses (see README.suite.md): for example, infinitives will *not* contribute to stats in terms of tense and person. 
They *can* however, contribute to such stats, if explicitly specified, as seen in the sixth line where *sues*, with POS set as ADJ, is still specified as PAST for TENSE. 
While the ordering of other feature specifications does not matter, here it does: feature specifications placed before the marking of a (different) morphosyntactic category are counted for the paradigm of the morpholexical category, whereas those placed after are counted for the paradigm of hte morphosyntactic category. 
This prevents calculations for tense on French nouns, and also allows different treatment for cases where the same feature is being marked in different paradigms (e.g. Albanian *ynë*, a genitive (pro)noun, which is plural as a noun but singular as an adjective). 
Furthermore (as explained at greater length in README.suite.md), the user can filter their analysis in terms of POS or morpholexical category (as well as specifying a narrower scope by setting other features). 

## PARADIGM SHAPE INPUT FILE
 
As languages differ in their paradigms and how they are shaped, a file is input at the function call to handle this. While using paradigm info is optional, if it is to be used, such a file must be input. Two sample files are in this directory: one for French ("FrenchParadigmShape") and one for "AlbanianParadigmShape"). Note that the former largely represents the paradigms of Old French, not modern French, nor Latin, for empirical reasons that are not relevant to this file. 

As with the lexicon files, '$' is the comment flag, and text on any line of a paradigm shape input file after '$' will be ignored by DiaSim. Comments on the "FrenchParadigmShape" file serve to explain some aspects of the file.
Furthermore, spaces within these files are only for aesthetic reasons, and will also be automatically stripped and ignored by DiaSim.
Tabs and line breaks, however, are very important as they govern section inclusion and section boundaries respectively.

A paradigm shape input file has three major parts, each separated by two line breaks. 

The first part defines abbreviations, and is headed by "ABBREVS", and has a number of lines following that all must be indented with a tab ("\t"). 
Each line equates two or more strings, and by convention (though not necessity), the shorter variant is placed first, and the longest is placed last. The longest is the one that will be used internally within DiaSim.

The next part, separated by a line break, is headed by "MORPHLEX" and enumerates the morpholexical classes to be used. 
Any of the names equated in the ABBREVS section above may be used, by convention the longer one is cited (DiaSim will automatically equate text equated in the ABBREVS section above). 
Each morpholexical class is declared on its own line. 
Like in the previous section, each line must be indented with a tab. 
If the morpholexical class introduced by a is not homonymous with its default morphosyntactic class, a second part of the line is necessary; this is also necessary if the morpholexical class has any *subclasses* (as will be explained below). 
If there are no subclasses, all that is necessary is that the default morphosyntactic class is stated between '{' and '}', placed after the declaration of the morpholexical class. See the example below for a hypothetical language with the morpholexical class `nominals' including only 'nouns': 

```
MORPHLEX
	NOMINAL {NOUN}
```

However, this is not the case with French or Albanian as treated in the sample paradigm shape files provided. 
Instead, these are both cases where the morpholexical class in question (NOMINAL) has multiple morphosyntactic classes associated to it: namely, NOUN and ADJ. NOUN is the default, so it is placed first with in the '{}' clause, delimited from ADJ by a ',', as seen below:

```
	NOMINAL {NOUN, ADJ}
	VERB
```

What this is indicates is that NOUN and ADJ items have the inflection/agreement patterns of NOMINALS, and that the default NOMINAL is a NOUN. 
Note that ADJ is placed under NOMINAL, but, as seen below, it is *not* a morphosyntactic class of VERB, even though there are adjective-treated forms that are part of a verbal paradigm (participles). 
This is because the listing of morphosyntactic categories for morpholexical categories in this section is for the purposes of what their paradigm values are. 
Furthermore note that INF (infinitive), a morphosyntactic category of a cell in the verbal paradigm, is not listed next to VERB, nor is it listed at all: this is because it lacks a paradigm, and thus it is handled in the next section with an empty branching. 

The third and final section is headed by MORPHSYN.
This section will list each morphosyntactic category in terms of the features it has, and the values for those features: essentially, the shape of its paradigm. 
Each *morphosyntactic* category heads its own subsection of this section, and is declared on a line indented by a single tab ('\t'). 
Each of its features will be declared on a double-indented (two tabs) line beneath this subsection header, in which each feature is declared, delimited from its possible values by ':', which are given in a list delimited by ','. 
In the FrenchParadigmShape file, there are three morphosyntactic categories declared: NOMINAL, VERB, and INF. 
The last, INF, is for infinitive, and does not have any features declared -- because an infinitive does not have its own paradigm in French. 
POS is not a declared feature here, but it is automatically associated to the paradigm of any morphosyntactic category with other features declared, and in the lexicon file, again, the default (as resulting from the previous section's input) will be applied if it is not explicitly specified. 
Note that in the AlbanianParadigmShape file, MODIFIER is declared as a morpholexical category with subcategories of ADV and PREP -- this means that unlike INF in French, MODIFIER in Albanian will be treated as specified for POS, by default with the value ADV.
It will be treated retaining its status as only morpholexically and morphosyntactically MODIFIER if the value of POS is ADV or PREP, but as  morphosyntactically NOMINAL (while morpholexically MODIFIER) if given teh value ADJ for POS. 
INF in French, on the other hand, is morpholexically always VERB, and morphosyntactically INF, which has no features to specify.
