$From Mildred Katherine Popeˌs 1934 "From Latin to Modern French"
$We follow exactly the order as stipulated in Chapter II starting on page 72, with some input from other chapters where appropriate
$However, she explains in her elaboration chapters some places where clearly the order is not what it is listed as in Chapter 4,
$ ... so we implement those instead

$l l > lʲ lʲ / [+hi,+front] __ [+hi,+front] 
$l > [+hi,+front] / [+hi,+front] __ [+hi,+front] $ Pope says this one is "probable"
$l > [+back] / @ __ $per page 75 s158, Pope specifically says is dark "every where else" giving examples of nolo and plenum
	$ she explicates that dark l existed continuously from Latin to French in various places: 
		$ s160-161 : references dark l existing, without this rule would be impossible
		$ s109b: dark L "in use in Latin and Period I of French"
		$ and for lʲ she similarly says it "survived into Old French after /i/" 
	$ these both cause obvious problems -- but what her stance (incorrectly) is seems clear
$ BASECLEF* CORRECTION: I don't think Pope's take on Latin /l/ is the canon one, and /l/ isn't her focus
	$ so for BaseCLEFstar we are using Allen 1978 pp33-34 on /l/
		$ what Pope identifies for back vowels he argues is pre-Classical Latin
			$ and argues /l/ was "clear" before all vowels in Classical Latin
	$ Alan has : dark l before word coda and non-lateral consonants for Classical Latin
	$ elsewhere "clear" l (i.e. in ll and before vowels). 
	$ Alan does not have palatalized l for any stage of Classical Latin.

{j;w} > [+cons,-son] / __ [+syl] $as per Pope s106 -- Pope considers w and j when not "vocalic" (i.e. part of diphthong) to be fricative
	$ for j, p55 s105c ; for w, p56 s109
$ Note that the sequence u: + w does not seem to occur in Latin 
$ If it did there would be some logical issues with Popeˌs rules -- i.e. s343 she states "beta from b" is effaced after u: 
	$ where of course w (by which she means gamma^w) had already shifted to beta s186 much earlier 
	$ -- of course sound change has no memory! However this issue is moot because u:+w doesnˌt occur in Latin it seems

$ BASECLEF* CORRECTION : Pope forgets to explicitly say that w is a proper w not ɣʷ after velar consonants hence why we don't end up with tons of kv clusters.
$ To be sure she does note (s186) that "betacism doesn't occur after k" but she doesn't notice that other affects she attriutes to ɣʷ are not occuring in the presence
$ of k -- such as the deletion of the rounded "fricative"/approximant before ʝ (indeed after kw, it is the ʝ that is deleted it seems...)

$ Pope attests this with the Appendix Probi, which was written in the third or fourth centuries but does not say that is when it specifically occurred. 
$ Because of words like "table", we know it probably occurred before lenition of intervocalic b (early second century) but Pope does not confirm this either.
