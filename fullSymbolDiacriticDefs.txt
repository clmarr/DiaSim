 ʰ = +sg $aspirated
 ʲ = +hi,+front $palatalized
 ˠ = +back $velarized. Currently not marked as +hi per current treatment of coronal laterals that are velarized in symbolDefs. For this reason may be used for uvulars too perhaps (even if heretically), unless this is changed in a custom local version. 
 ʷ = +lab,+hi,+back,+round $labiovelarized
 ᶣ = +lab,+hi,+front,+round $labiopalatalized. Note that the current one used in symbolDefs.csv for ɡᶣ and kᶣ does not trigger +round 
 ˤ = +lo,+back $pharyngealized.
 ˡ = +lat $lateral release.
 ̃ = +nas
 ̈ = -back,-front $centralized. 
 ̍ = +syl
 ̊ = -voi
 ̥ = -voi
 ̬ = +voi
 ̪ = +ant,+cor,+distr $dental. 
 ̯ = -syl 
 ̩ = +syl
 ˀ= +cg $glottalization. Currently realized in feature defs with same feature as creaky voice (which is how it is realized on sonorants, including vowels), and +cg has been used for both each in the past. 
 ̰ = +cg $constrict glottis, proxy for creaky voiced segments. 
 ̤ = +sg $spread glottis, can be proxy for breathy voiced segments.
 ̹ = +round $weakly rounded, typically for coronals. Patterns/marked as round but not labial.
 ᵝ= +lab $labialized but no velar aspect  
 ˈ= +stres,+prim
 ˌ= +stres,-prim
 ːː= +splng $must be defined before long or it will just be interpreted as (potentially runtime error-triggering) duplication of the long marker.   
 ː= +long
