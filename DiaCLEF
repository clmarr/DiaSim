$From Mildred Katherine Pope's 1934 "From Latin to Modern French"
$We follow exactly the order as stipulated in Chapter II starting on page 72, with some input from other chapters where appropriate
$However, she explains in her elaboration chapters some places where clearly the order is not what it is listed as in Chapter 4,
$ ... so we implement those instead

$Characteristics of Classical Latin as per Pope page 75
n̪ > ŋ / __ [+hi,+back,-cont]
ɡ > ŋ / __ [+nas,+cor]

$ CORRECTION: We delete Pope's handling of Classical Latin's variant l-allophones, as they do not seem to be diachronically relevant, and harm performance.

[+lo] > [-front,+back]
[+lo] > [+front,-back] / __ e̯
{j;w} > [+cons,-son] / __ [+syl] $as per Pope s106 -- Pope considers w and j when not "vocalic" (i.e. part of diphthong) to be fricative
	$ for j, p55 s105c ; for w, p56 s109
$ Note that the sequence u: + w does not seem to occur in Latin 
$ If it did there would be some logical issues with Pope's rules -- i.e. s343 she states "beta from b" is effaced after u: 
	$ where of course w (by which she means gamma^w) had already shifted to beta s186 much earlier 
	$ -- of course sound change has no memory! However this issue is moot because u:+w doesn't occur in Latin it seems
	
$ CORRECTION : Pope forgets to explicitly say that w is a proper w not ɣʷ after velar consonants hence why we don't end up with tons of kv clusters.
$ To be sure she does note (s186) that "betacism doesn't occur after k" but she doesn't notice that other affects she attriutes to ɣʷ are not occuring in the presence
$ of k -- such as the deletion of the rounded "fricative"/approximant before ʝ (indeed after kw, it is the ʝ that is deleted it seems...)

$ beginning of Late Latin shifts here... 
$As per Pope's paradigm, it is considered Late Latin if it occurred before the end of the firth century 

$p144 s359 ~ p73 s156iii --- ns > s, with compensatory lengthening of prior vowel -- must have occurred before nature of length changed
$Pope says "very early" s359
$CORRECTION: now lengthening occurs in the context of non-stressed following syllable, and the n loss is triggered by being between a specifically long vowel and s.
[+syl] > [+long] / __ n̪ s ([-syl])* [-stres] 
n̪ > ∅ / [+syl,+long] __  s

$p144 s359 ~ p73 s156iii --- rs > s after long vowels, > ss after short vowels
	$must have occurred before nature of length changed
	$ implicitly consecutive vowels are "long" and second becomes so if not-- case of deorsum
$ CORRECTION : we only implement the stipulated shifts occurring after long vowels and two vowel sequences,
$ Because the rs > ss shift after single short vowels seems to only be correct for two lexemes, persica and dorsum.
[+cor,+son,-nas,-lat] > ∅ / [+syl,+long] __ s
[+cor,+son,-nas,-lat] > ∅ / [-cons] [-cons] __ s

$ CORRECTION: long e: before j becomes short

$ the gliding phenomenon below

$p102 s220 (also p73 s156i)  -- yod and w formation -- gliding of unstressed short non-low vowels before other vowels
$ -- called upon to be this early by p91 s187
[+syl,-long,-stres,-lo] > [+hi,-syl,+tense] / __ [+syl]

$ CORRECTION: uː unstressed becomes sonus medius -- diachronically equivalent to ɪ -- before a non syllable and not near word boundary -- but does not bleed prior yod formation (see adiu:ta:re) or feed it (manu:opera)
uː > ɪ / __ [-syl] @

$ per s220 : yod is lost between e and p,r

$ w, newly from u,o in hiatus is clearly NOT effected by this as per treatment in s374

$p91 s187iia
$ CORRECTION: This seems to only reliably occur after /ɑ/ and /ɑː/ -- this is a better reason why vivum, ovum and nativum are unaffected than "analogy" (which Pope says in s188).
ɣʷ > ∅ / [+lo] __ [+syl,+round]

$ as per s186iib -- w effaced between k and a rounded vowel
	$ Note most authors interpret this differently, as the delabialization of k

$ p115 s261-264 ~ s221 ~ s156i
$ *** Note as per s156i, for Pope this is a "tendency" 
$ the slurring ... of "proparoxytones" ... i.e. where the tonic syllable was followed by two unstressed sylls before hte word coda
$ ... typically concerning those which are common suffixes here.
$ Pope attests this with the Appendix Probi, which was written in the third or fourth centuries but does not say that is when it specifically occurred. 
$ Because of words like "table", we know it probably occurred before lenition of intervocalic b (early second century) but Pope does not confirm this either. 
$ By placing it here before the beginning of betacism, we are giving Pope the benefit of the doubt. 
$ This is also inline with what she states about the -itus,-itum etc group -- she is holding that this phenomenon occurred before hte beginnings
$ 	of palatalization  (s296)
$ Further note : s262b -- Pope notes that sometimes the older forms were restored by preservative analogy via "clerkly influence" 
$ p115 s262a -- effects on -ulus,-ulum,-ula words. Attested for affecting those where preceding cons is k,g,t,p or b. There don't seem to be

$ p115 s262b -- effects on the -idus,-idis,-itis etc group : for prior consonsants Pope lists l, g, t, s, k, and r
	$ the most faithful way to render this also in line with Occam's Razor would seem to be [+cons] 
	$ *** NOTE s353 -- seems to imply it was possible for this to NOT occur for some words
	$ note also the frigidus contradiction: s297 & s316 vs. s262ii & s296i
$ CORRECTION: ɪ does not disappear before t at this point as all the affected words (hospitem, comitem, lenditem, limitem) need to eject ə after final vowels are lost
$ CORRECTION: ɪ only disappears before d[+front,-lo] when after a sonorant (magidem must also eject ə -- so cluster must be formed in Gallo-Roman stage)
$ CORRECTION: ɪ before dʊ does not disappear if previous consonant is voiceless, as these will need to eject ə in Gallo-Roman when final vowels are lost (muccidum, nitidum, sapidum, tepidum)

$ Pope lists avica and avicellum as having been effected by "slurring" in s187i 
	$but doesn't state that i was slurred here explicitly elsewhere
ɪ > ∅ / ɣʷ __ k

$as per p91 s187i -- ɣʷ > w when preconsonantal due to "slurring"
ɣʷ > w / __ [+cons]

$ CORRECTION: a much more effective and thorough way to describe the 
	$apparent contexts of deconsonantalization of ɣʷ here...
$ actually covering two shifts
$ it appears that this occurred in all ɑɣʷɪ sequences : navicellam, navicam, avicam, avicellam, Pictavis, etc...
$ Pope (s187i) says this is due to "slurring" but she nowhere else described the "slurring" phenomenon that would have fed the rule in this way
$ Doesn't happen when the posterior ɪ is stressed it seems -- see kˌɑwˈɪkulɑm > ʃəvij
$ Hence this is the most efficient way to represent it...: 
ɣʷ > w / [+lo] __ ɪ 
$ next, to cover the ɑɣʷɑ sequences: bauam, flavam, cavannum. 
$Doesn't seem to happen for -aːre verbs (lava:re) -- this can be represented by only allowing the posterior ɑ to be short
ɣʷ > w / [+lo] __ [+lo,-long]

$p91 s186: w>beta. Occurred during the 1st and 2nd century ("Nerβa")
$ CORRECTION : as evidenced by Pope s343 causing errors for 10 words that became β from ɣʷ,
$ they did not merge this early, and must have merged AFTER that -- instead we send ɣʷ to βʷ 
ɣʷ > βʷ

$p73 s155iia and pp136-137 ss332-336 and p6 s9 : b > β intervocalically or between vowel and r (s372)
$According to s336 this occurred very early at least for the bilabial, 2nd century AD 
$Later authors group all voiced stops together for this shift, but Pope is unclear
$She states (s336) that it is attested earlier for b than the others but is unclear
$However she indicates a shift order in s307i that necessitates velar stop palatalization preceding intervocalic lenition
$So we give her the benefit of the doubt and place the lenition of the rest of the velar stops later,
$Right after the beginning of palatalization.
$ she is not clear about whether her j and w ("fricatives") are sonorant, but we will assume they are NOT
	$... given that she called them fricatives -- this is supported by her trajectory for rubeum > rouge (s676)
b > β / [+syl] __ [+son,-lat,-nas]

$ p115 s263 -- with proparoxytons with intervocalic g, both g and preceding vowel deleted "early" (s263)

[-stres] ɡ > ∅ / [+prim] ([-syl])* __ [-stres] ([-syl])* #

$ per Pope s185 and s198, combination of vowels that have become adjacent and share the same quality become a single long vowel of same quality
$ in practice this only happens for e'e and o'o. They become tense too. 
$ CORRECTION: o'o made tense.

$ Pope notes it did not occur in monosyllabic words 
$ NOTE: as per p97-98 s205i -- unlike Italy and also South Gaul, North Gaul did not see effacement of s and t word-finally,

$ ... tsʲ is handled separately
$ There is evidence that the deletion of j in -ier endings centuries later, which Pope and others attributed to analogy, can instead be explained regularly

			$ except in cases where the prior palatal consonant was preceded by countertonic i or e

$ however it is NOT the stage set we use for FLLAPs, in which "Old French I" comes a bit later. 

$ Pope s257 : unstressed ə > e before yod. She implies this is also happening before ʎ and ɲ in her examples
$ s252 : this feeds ej > oj phenomena.
ə > e / __ [+front,+son,+hi,-syl]

$ s329 and s484 countertonic e becomes o before w and tonic u -- doesn't state when explicitly other than "in Early Old French" 
$she doesn't seem to mention this being effected by former o,
	$ so we assume it comes before s166.2 ~ s184

ˌe > ˌo / __ [+hi,+round,+prim] 

$ s422 e "intertonic" (i.e. stress-less) moves up to i before palatal consonants (ɲ,ʎ)
$ CORRECTION : this is moved back, originally in LOF
e > i / __ [+hi,+son,+front,+cons]

$s166.9 ~ s383-391 -- "beginnings" of l-vocalization praeconsonantal. 
$As per Pope s167, "unclear" how much and if the vocalization aspect was present during this period.
$First attested in 9th century -- s390.

$s382iv and s384 : but back l becomes ʎ after i (originally Pope has this as lʲ, but Occam's razor as

$ CORRECTION: countertonic ˌe to ˌə can bleed second nasalization -- moved before it. 
$ s166.5 ~ ~s223 ~ s234-235 reduction of ˌe > schwa when free. 
$ Due to increasing weight of stressed syllables.

$ CORRECTION: initial countertonic schwa to e

$ CORRECTION: moved from Later Old French to here so it is before effacement of z 
$ CORRECTION: ð goes to z before n specifically when r is on otherside of syllable, and is followed by n 
$ CORRECTION: ð is simply deleted without going to z if between non-primary stressed vowel and m

$ s166.10 effacement of preconsonantal z, accompanied by compensatory lengthening of prior vowel. 
$ Complete before the Norman Conquest of England (1066) as per s377
$ CORRECTION: lengthening doesn't happen before d -- it seems z is simply absorbed
$ CORRECTION: does not occur word-initially
$ CORRECTION: for countertonics, lengthening only happens when next syllable is either long or a diphthong

		$ cle:ta : attested as claie in 1306
		$ mone:tam : monoie in 1170 then monnoie in 1245, but attested as monae 1296
$ There are other interpretations of this that are tempting, but do not seem to work 
	$One is that ð and θ disappeared early (as Pope argues), and fed the previous added shift where oj went to ʌj before ə then coda #
$		 However there is an issue with this: Pope and all the relevant literature argue that ð and θ disappeared at the same time
		$ and where it is θ disappearing and not ð to create the environment of ojə#, the shift does not occur
		$ example : ficatum > fojəθ > fwa (foie), not *fɛ (*faie)
		$ example 2 : plicat > plojəθ > plwa (ploie), not *plɛ (*plaie) 
			$ this also would not explain why we see the same pattern in oide words (rigidam > roide >raide) 
				$ except those preceded by labial elements which rerounded ʌ (via > voie, frigida > froide, lampreda > lamproie)
	$Another is that ð and θ disappeared early and there was a global shift where this would have occurred
		$ this works for the ojðə# segments, but not the ojðrə# segments (voirre > verre, attested in 1200; tonitrum > tonerre, etc...)
		$ It appears unrounding before rə only occurs where ð once was, meaning ð really may have survived longer than we thought
	$one way to explain this is that the shift originally manifested in a conservative lower class dialect 
		$ that did not make it into the written form into a bit after it happened 
		$ i.e. it occurred in the late 12th century,
$			early enough to be conditioned on ð just as it was about to vanish when we first see
$			roie become raie and voirre became vairre [1200], but did not become widespread in the writing until around 1300 
				$ when we begin to see craie 1290, monae 1296, claie 1306, etc.)
			$ this also would not explain why there is similar behavior before d (rigidam > roide > raide) 
		$ all exceptions except se:tam can be explained by a rule by which teh former uj is restored under the influence of preceding
			$ labial elements 
$ Like above, it is likely this sound, which saw delayed entrance into the written language except for a few words (raie, verre)
	$ was neither really an a or an o for about a century-- hence ʌ is a good guess, with Canadian raising being a good analog
