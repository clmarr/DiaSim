$We follow exactly the order as stipulated in Chapter II starting on page 72, with some input from other chapters where appropriate

$Characteristics of Classical Latin as per Pope page 75
$ CORRECTION: We delete Pope's handling of Classical Latin's variant /l/ forms,
	 $as they do not seem to be diachronically relevant, 
	 	$and harm performance.
n̪ > ŋ / __ [+hi,+back,-cont]
ɡ > ŋ / __ [+nas,+cor]
[+lo] > [-front,+back]
[+lo] > [+front,-back] / __ e̯
{j;w} > [+cons,-son] / __ [+syl] $as per Pope s106 -- Pope considers w and j when not "vocalic" (i.e. part of diphthong) to be fricative
	$ for j, p55 s106c ; for w, p56 s109
$ Note that the sequence u: + w does not seem to occur in Latin 
$ If it did there would be some logical issues with Pope's rules -- i.e. s343 she states "beta from b" is effaced after u: 
	$ where of course w (by which she means gamma^w) had already shifted to beta s186 much earlier 
	$ -- of course sound change has no memory! However this issue is moot because u:+w doesn't occur in Latin it seems
	
$ CORRECTION : Pope forgets to explicitly say that w is a proper w not ɣʷ after velar consonants hence why we don't end up with tons of kv clusters.
$ To be sure she does note (s186) that "betacism doesn't occur after k" but she doesn't notice that other affects she attributes to ɣʷ are not occurring in the presence
$ of k -- such as the deletion of the rounded "fricative"/approximant before ʝ (indeed after kw, it is the ʝ that is deleted it seems...) 
ɣʷ > w / [+back,+hi,+cons] __ 

$2024 CORRECTION: d before consonantal obstruents and nasals undergoes total assimilation (ad satis, prefixation etc.) 
	$unclear what happened before l, but there is already a rule in Gallo-Roman that lateralizes -d- in secondary -dl- clusters (cf. querquedulam > sarcelle) 
	$ however, this is clearly different from the fate of secondary -dm- and -dn-, which can become -zm-, -rn-, -zn- (in Early Old French)

$a more modest assimilation for clusters in bC.
	$ -br- -- not included as these clearly show the same developments as secondary -(b/p>β)r clusters
	$ -bl- probably has the same outcome (βl) as secondary (b >β)l clusters, 
			$sublongus > selonc > selon however is troublesome, but not enough to justify different treatment. 
	$ -bt- seems to show some dynamism later so should not be assimilated at this stage (subte:la:re > OF sodler!) 
	$ -bsC- > -sC- happens by Later Old French but it is likely later. 
	$ -bd- and -bs- seem already handled elsewhere, though in the latter there may be grounds to reconsider (absentum > Old Picard ausent? Etc.) 
	$ b-velar clusters are not attested 
	$ -bf- clusters clearly go to -ff- in French but it may ony be later -- obflare > Fr. offler but Auvergnat aufler. 
	$ -bp- clusters will alreayd be handled by Gallo-Roman voicing assimilation
	$ this leaves -bm-. Except for some cases of analogy (e.g. submergere > Ofr sur-marger, vs. Prov. somerger), these do merge with -mm- 
		$ (e.g. cumminus > conmin, coumin,c'min -- same set of regional outcomes as -bm-,  it seems)

$p144 s359 ~ p73 s156iii --- ns > s, with compensatory lengthening of prior vowel -- must have occurred before nature of length changed
$Pope says "very early" s359
$CORRECTION: now lengthening occurs in the context of non-stressed following syllable,

	$ implicitly consecutive vowels are "long" and second becomes so if not-- case of deorsum
$ CORRECTION : we only implement the stipulated shifts occurring 
	$after long vowels and two vowel sequences, and not after two vowel sequences either.
	$ Because the rs > ss shift after single short vowels 
	$ seems to only be correct for two lexemes, persica and dorsum.

$p91 s187iia
$ CORRECTION: This seems to only reliably occur after /ɑ/ and /ɑː/ -- this is a better reason why vivum, ovum and nativum are unaffected than "analogy" (which Pope says in s188).

$ p115 s261-264 ~ s221 ~ s156i
$ *** Note as per s156i, for Pope this is a "tendency" 
$ the slurring ... of "proparoxytones" ... i.e. where the tonic syllable was followed by two unstressed sylls before hte word coda
$ ... typically concerning those which are common suffixes here.
$ Pope attests this with the Appendix Probi, which was written in the third or fourth centuries but does not say that is when it specifically occurred. 
$ Because of words like "table", we know it probably occurred before lenition of intervocalic b (early second century) but Pope does not confirm this either. 
$ By placing it here before the beginning of betacism, we are giving Pope the benefit of the doubt. 
$ This is also inline with what she states about the -itus,-itum etc group -- she is holding that this phenomenon occurred before hte beginnings
$ 	of palatalization  (s296)
$ Further note : s262b -- Pope notes that sometimes the older forms were restored by preservative analogy via "clerkly influence" 
$ p115 s262a -- effects on -ulus,-ulum,-ula words. Attested for affecting those where preceding cons is k,g,t,p or b. There don't seem to be
	$ any words of this type ending in -dulus,-dulum, or -dula. 
$ CORRECTION : -mulum endings also effected (cumulum > comble; tremulum > tremble) 
$ CORRECTION : -rula endings also effected (berula (Gaul.) > berle not bierle) 
$ CORRECTION: -olum,-olus endings also included if not after a labial stop

$ p115 s262b -- effects on the -idus,-idis,-itis etc group : for prior consonsants Pope lists l, g, t, s, k, and r
	$ the most faithful way to render this also in line with Occam's Razor would seem to be [+cons] 
	$ *** NOTE s353 -- seems to imply it was possible for this to NOT occur for some words
	$ note also the frigidus contradiction: s297 & s316 vs. s262ii & s296i
$ CORRECTION: ɪ does not disappear before t at this point as all the affected words (hospitem, comitem, lenditem, limitem) need to eject ə after final vowels are lost
$ CORRECTION: ɪ only disappears before d[+front,-lo] when after a sonorant (magidem must also eject ə -- so cluster must be formed in Gallo-Roman stage)
$ CORRECTION: ɪ before dʊ does not disappear if previous consonant is voiceless, as these will need to eject ə in Gallo-Roman when final vowels are lost (muccidum, nitidum, sapidum, tepidum)
	$ CORRECTION: it DOES disappear before voiced stops though (frigidum)

$as per p91 s187i -- ɣʷ > w when preconsonantal due to "slurring"

$ CORRECTION: a much more effective and thorough way to describe the 
	$apparent contexts of deconsonantalization of ɣʷ here...
$ actually covering two shifts
$ it appears that this occurred in all ɑɣʷɪ sequences : navicellam, navicam, avicam, avicellam, Pictavis, etc...
$ Pope (s187i) says this is due to "slurring" but she nowhere else described the "slurring" phenomenon that would have fed the rule in this way
$ Doesn't happen when the posterior ɪ is stressed it seems -- see kˌɑwˈɪkulɑm > ʃəvij
$ Hence this is the most efficient way to represent it...: 
$ CORRECTION : abrogated for now as no effect due to correction @ line 175

$ next, to cover the ɑɣʷɑ sequences: bauam, flavam, cavannum.

ɣʷ > w / [+lo] __ [+lo,-long]

$p91 s186: w>beta. Occurred during the 1st and 2nd century ("Nerβa")
$ CORRECTION : as evidenced by Pope s343 causing errors for 10 words that became β from ɣʷ,
$ they did not merge this early, and must have merged AFTER that -- instead we send ɣʷ to βʷ 
$ NOTE: delete and reinsert the <ʷ> to turn off/on the demo
ɣʷ > βʷ

$p73 s155iia and pp136-137 ss332-336 and p6 s9 : b > β intervocalically or between vowel and r (s372)
$According to s336 this occurred very early at least for the bilabial, 2nd century AD 
$Later authors group all voiced stops together for this shift, but Pope is unclear
$She states (s336) that it is attested earlier for b than the others but is unclear
$However she indicates a shift order in s307i that necessitates velar stop palatalization preceding intervocalic lenition
$So we give her the benefit of the doubt and place the lenition of the rest of the velar stops later,
$Right after the beginning of palatalization.
$ she is not clear about whether her j and w ("fricatives") are sonorant, but we will assume they are NOT
	$... given that she called them fricatives -- this is supported by her trajectory for rubeum > rouge (s676)
$ CORRECTION (2024): restriction against acting before laterals and nasals. 
	$ There are no original -bn- or -bl- clusters in Latin so the rule may have been hyperspecified to begin with.
	$ However, secondary -βl- clusters due to syncope become -bl- in much of oil (incl. Francien) anyways so these would too if this became β
		$ and the case of sublongus > selon suggests weakening of the /b/ in -bl- anyways

$She states (s336) that it is attested earlier for b than the others but is unclear
$Her tables show a lenition of g to gamma for Late Latin but not d to delta
$However she indicates a shift order in s307i that necessitates velar stop palatalization preceding intervocalic lenition
$So we give her the benefit of the doubt and place the lenition of the rest of the velar stops later,

$ CORRECTION: palatalized coronals, excluding tsʲ are actually preserved into Old French in a specific position between a palatal continuant cons and i
$ ... tsʲ is handled separately
$ There is evidence that the deletion of j in -ier endings centuries later, which Pope and others attributed to analogy, can instead be explained regularly
	$ as the absorption of yod by a persistently palatalized coronal
	$ that it was absorbed by palatal segments that uncontroversially remained -- ʃ,ʒ,ʎ and ɲ at that point -- is the consensus view
		$ to this list, we add persistently palatalized coronals, which persisted between two palatal segments (consonantal or not)
			$ except in cases where the prior palatal consonant was preceded by countertonic i or e 
		$ persistently palatalized coronals will disappear after they can condition the loss of j in those endings
	$ this may be more likely than analogy (we argue for palatal persistence 
		$because otherwise there would have to be a significant change in the chronology of diphthong developments 
			$so that 'ie > j'e happened much earlier

$ CORRECTION : unrounding and lowering of u in ˈuj before ə then # in late 12th century
$ Pope argues that oi > ai shifting only occured under Italian influence in Middle French
$ However, there is textual evidence of it beginning in this context much earlier, and no exceptions
$ # Example: rika (<Gaulish) appeared became roie under the rounding ei by 1140, but in ** 1170 we see it attested as raie
	$ and the formation of rayure (raie + ure)  www.cnrtl.fr/definition/raie
$ It is likely the sound used was a rare allophonic sound mostly absent elsewhere in the language
	$ which was neither round enough to be o 
	$ nor low or front enough to be a 
	$ therefore ʌ makes a good guess.
$ the two exceptions to this -- via and korrigia -- are handled by an later exception rule 
$ CORRECTION: unrounding and lowering of u in uj before j d ə , j ð ə and j ð r ə in late 12th century
$ Pope argues that oi > ai shifting only occurred under Italian influence, and specifically centuries later in Middle French
$ She also argues that ð was lost during the 12th century, not hte end of it. 
$ However, there is textual evidence pointing toward some sort of oj-unroudning occurring where ð was about to leave a hiatus
	$ but NOT where θ would create the necessary context 
$ witrum: voirre in 1174-1187, but becoming "verre" and "warre" in 1200
		$ cre:ta : attested as croie in 1175, but then craie in the root for craiere in 1290
		$ cle:ta : attested as claie in 1306
		$ mone:tam : monoie in 1170 then monnoie in 1245, but attested as monae 1296
$ There are other interpretations of this that are tempting, but do not seem to work 
	$One is that ð and θ disappeared early (as Pope argues), and fed the previous added shift where oj went to ʌj before ə then coda #
$		 However there is an issue with this: Pope and all the relevant literature argue that ð and θ disappeared at the same time
		$ and where it is θ disappearing and
			$n not ð to create the environment of ojə#, the shift does not occur
		$ example : ficatum > fojəθ > fwa (foie), not *fɛ (*faie)
		$ example 2 : plicat > plojəθ > plwa (ploie), not *plɛ (*plaie) 
			$ this also would not explain why we see the same pattern in oide words (rigidam > roide >raide) 
				$ except those preceded by labial elements which rerounded ʌ (via > voie, frigida > froide, lampreda > lamproie)
	$Another is that ð and θ disappeared early and there was a global shift where this would have occurred
		$ this works for the ojðə# segments, but not the ojðrə# segments (voirre > verre, attested in 1200; tonitrum > tonerre, etc...)
		$ It appears unrounding before rə only occurs where ð once was, meaning ð really may have survived longer than we thought
	$one way to explain this is that the shift originally manifested in a conservative lower class dialect 
		$ that did not make it into the written form into a bit after it happened 
		$ i.e. it occurred in the late 12th century,
$			early enough to be conditioned on ð just as it was about to vanish when we first see
$			roie become raie and voirre became vairre [1200], but did not become widespread in the writing until around 1300 
				$ when we begin to see craie 1290, monae 1296, claie 1306, etc.)
			$ this also would not explain why there is similar behavior before d (rigidam > roide > raide) 
		$ all exceptions except se:tam can be explained by a rule by which teh former uj is restored under the influence of preceding
			$ labial elements 
$ Like above, it is likely this sound, which saw delayed entrance into the written language except for a few words (raie, verre)
	$ was neither really an a or an o for about a century-- hence ʌ is a good guess, with Canadian raising being a good analog
$NOTE: in later review with FranTEXT, this looks very dubious -- cited in paper as case where PATCH with DiaSim may have led us astray.

$ CORRECTION: Pope does note a few of the effects of this shift in s496 but she attributes the main effect of the shift to

$ However, she missed that there is a consistent context here : exclusively countertonic ˌɛ
